Projects Overview: 
This repository contains 5 intermediate-level C projects, showcasing my 1-month progress as I learned the C programming language. All of these projects were developed with the help of some AI tools to guide me through the process.

Projects:
1. Number Guessing Game (number_guessing_game.c)
Time Spent: 3 days
Description: A simple game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess to help the player.
Learning: This was my first project, and I used a bit of AI to help with the logic for random number generation and input validation.

2. Scientific Calculator (scientific_calculator_app.c)
Time Spent: 2 days
Description: A basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations and scientific functions like trigonometry, square roots, and exponents.
Learning: I used a little AI help to implement some of the more advanced functions and to ensure proper handling of input/output.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (tic_tac_toe_game.c)
Time Spent: 6 days
Description: A 2-player game where players alternate turns on a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O'. The game checks for win conditions and displays the game board.
Learning: This was a more challenging project where I used a bit more AI help to implement the game logic, win conditions, and display updates.

4. Time App (time_app.c)
Time Spent: 2 weeks
Description: A multi-functional time management app that includes a stopwatch, timer, alarm, Pomodoro timer, and real-time clock.
Learning: I relied heavily on AI for this project due to its complexity. I needed help with time-related functions, handling user input, and managing multiple features simultaneously.

5. To-Do List App (to_do_list_app.c)
Time Spent: 4 days
Description: A to-do list app that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. It saves tasks between sessions.
Learning: I used a little AI help to work out how to store and manage tasks efficiently. It was my final project in the month, and I felt confident applying my C skills.

About This Collection: 
Total Time to Complete: 1 month
Learning Journey: I started learning C programming with basic concepts and gradually tackled more complex projects. These projects represent my growth as a beginner in C, using both self-study and AI assistance for guidance.
